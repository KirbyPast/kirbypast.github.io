                            the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and
                            a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over
                            95 times more massive.

                            and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to

                            At least 83 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not
                            include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second
                            largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is
                            the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

                            father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus
                            Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a horizontal stroke, as an
                            abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronus). It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with
                            the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize this pagan symbol.

                            helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid core. Saturn's
                            rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the
                            poles and bulges at its equator.

                            Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less.
                            Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of
                            the planet is 0.69 g/cm^3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's mass, and
                            Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total
                            planetary mass in the Solar System.

                            Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter,
                            having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various
                            volatiles.Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times
                            more energy into space than it receives from the Sun.

                            element in the Sun. The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known
                            precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the

                            Saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually
                            unique. The rings extend from 6,630 to 120,700 kilometers (4,120 to 75,000 mi) outward from
                            Saturn's equator and average approximately 20 meters (66 ft) in thickness. They are composed
                            predominantly of water ice, with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating
                            of approximately 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings range in size
                            from specks of dust up to 10 m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's
                            is the largest and most visible.
