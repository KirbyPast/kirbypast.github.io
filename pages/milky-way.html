                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes the Solar System and appears as a hazy band of light in the night sky. It is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8  1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400  3,590 light-years). It is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster and Laniakea Supercluster. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars in 1610.

It is located at a radius of 27,000 light-years (8.3 kpc) from the Galactic Center, which is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*. Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second (136 miles per second).

The Milky Way is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second (372 miles per second) with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.

It is smaller than the Andromeda Galaxy's isophotal diameter and slightly below the mean isophotal sizes of the galaxies. An estimate from 1997 gave an isophotal diameter for the Milky Way at 26.8  1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400  3,590 light-years).

Estimates of its mass vary, with the low end being 5.81011 solar masses. Measurements in 2009 found velocities as large as 254 km/s for stars at the outer edge of the Milky Way. The mass of the entire Milky Way is estimated to be 8.51011 M, but this is only half the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy. Much of the mass of the Milky Way seems to be dark matter.

It may also contain ten billion white dwarfs, a billion neutron stars, and a hundred million stellar black holes. Beyond a radius of roughly 40,000 light years (13 kpc), the concentration of stars decreases with distance from the center. Surrounding the galactic disk is a spherical galactic halo of stars and globular clusters, limited in size by the orbits of two Milky Way satellites, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.

Over 300 million habitable exoplanets are estimated to exist in the Milky Way Galaxy.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">The Milky Way is a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a warped disk of gas, dust and stars. Astronomers first began to conjecture that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy in the 1960s. These conjectures were confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope observations in 2005 that showed the Milky Way's central bar to be larger than previously thought. The Galactic Center is located between 25,000–28,000 ly (7.7–8.6 kpc) from the Sun. In the inner few kiloparsecs (around 10,000 light-years radius) is a dense concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called the bulge.</font>
