                            planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter,

                            rather than by empirical observation.

                            its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its
                            greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed
                            primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface.

                            times the surface gravity of Earth, and surpassed only by Jupiter. Neptune's equatorial
                            radius of 24,764 km is nearly four times that of Earth. Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice
                            giant, a subclass of giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher concentrations
                            of volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn. </font>

                            the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's

                            light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue, although
                            Neptune's blue differs from Uranus's milder light blue.

                            lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where
                            temperature increases with altitude. The boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a
                            pressure of 0.1 bars (10 kPa).

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">The formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven
                            difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer
                            regions of the Solar System was too low to account for the formation of such large bodies
                            from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been
                            advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core
                            accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their
                            atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">An alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun,
                            where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits
                            after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after
                            formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations
                            of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region.
