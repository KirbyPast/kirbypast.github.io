                            Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the
                            other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the
                            mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky
                            after the Moon and Venus.

                            astronomical units; 500 million miles) long. Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and

                            named after the chief god of the divine pantheon: Zeus to the Greeks and Jupiter to the
                            Romans. The International Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the
                            planet in 1976, and has since named its newly discovered satellites for the god's lovers,
                            favourites, and descendants.</span></font>

                            Thursday.It has been theorized that this replaced the Latin name for the day, Dies Iovi
                            ('Day of Jupiter'). The Latin name Iovis is associated with the etymology of Zeus ('sky

                            rather than solid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of
                            142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator. The average density of Jupiter is about
                            the same as sugar syrup (syrup USP), and is lower than those of the four terrestrial
                            planets.

                            approximately 24% helium by mass.The atmosphere also contains trace amounts of methane,
                            water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds,the interior of Jupiter contains denser
                            materials—by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements.

                            persistent anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator. It is known to have existed
                            since at least 1831, and possibly since 1665.The Great Red Spot is larger than the
                            Earth.Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and will be a permanent feature
