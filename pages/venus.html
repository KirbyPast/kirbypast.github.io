                            natural object in the night sky after the Sun and the Moon . Its observed stellar magnitude
                            reaches -4.6 m and is sufficient for reflected light from Venus to create shadows; it is
                            rarely visible to the naked eye during the day. </font>

                            planet" due to their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and chemical composition. In
                            other respects it differs radically from Terra. It has the densest atmosphere of the four
                            telluric planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide . Atmospheric pressure at the
                            planet's surface is 92 times that on Earth, or about the pressure found 900 m underwater on
                            Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, with an average surface
                            temperature of 735 K (462 °C ; 863 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.</font>

                            in the Solar System, creating surface temperatures of at least 735 K (462 °C).This makes the
                            surface of Venus hotter than that of Mercury , which has a minimum surface temperature of 53
                            K (−220 °C) and a maximum surface temperature of 700 K (427 °C),even though Venus is almost
                            twice as far from the Sun as Mercury and receives only 25% of Mercury's solar irradiance.
                            This temperature is higher than that used for sterilization.

                            atmosphere from the solar nebula have been proposed to explain the enrichment.

                            volcanic activity. Venus has more volcanoes than Earth, 167 of which are large volcanoes
                            that are over 100 km in diameter. The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big
                            Island of Hawaii. This is not because Venus has more active volcanic activity than Earth,
                            but because its crust is older.

                            To the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or
                            star (apart from the Sun ).The mean apparent magnitude of the planet is −4.14 with a
                            standard deviation of 0.31. Brightest magnitude occurs in the crescent phase about a month
                            before or after inferior conjunction. Venus dims to magnitude −3 when backlit by the Sun.The
                            planet is bright enough to be seen in a clear midday sky, and is more easily visible when
                            the Sun is low on the horizon or at sunset. It never moves away from the Sun more than about
                            47°.

                            does so, it changes from the "Evening Glow", visible after sunset, to the "Morning Glow",
                            visible before sunrise. Although Mercury reaches a maximum elongation (declination from the
                            Sun) of only 28° and is often difficult to see in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is
                            at its brightest. Its significant maximum elongation means that it is visible in dark skies
                            long after sunset. As the brightest object in the sky, Venus is often interpreted by
                            non-astronomers as an " unidentified flying object ".
