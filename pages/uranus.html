                            third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. The
                            planet is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which
                            differ from those of the other two giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants). For
                            this reason, scientists often distinguish Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants".

                            hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along
                            with traces of other hydrocarbons.</font>

                            (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which was rendered as Uranus in Latin .

                            British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new
                            planet even Neptune George III or Neptune Great Britain.

                            version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos.Bode argued that the name should follow the
                            mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an
                            appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans.

                            least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune's at
                            roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27 g/cm^3 makes Uranus the second
                            least dense planet, after Saturn.This value indicates that it is made primarily of various
                            ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.</font>

                            those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate
                            classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules
                            break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in
                            which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.

                            other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux. Why Uranus's internal
                            temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus's near twin in size
                            and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun,
                            but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all,the total power radiated by Uranus in the
                            far infrared.

                            and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour.
