                            Charles Messier in 1781. In 2006, NASA and the European Space Agency released a very
                            detailed image of the Pinwheel Galaxy, which was the largest and most-detailed image of a
                            galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope at the time. The image was composed of 51 individual
                            exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos.

                            "nebula without star, very obscure and pretty large, 6' to 7' in diameter". William Herschel
                            wrote in 1784 that the galaxy was one of several which had a mottled kind of nebulosity.

                            reflector during the second half of the 19th century and was the first to make extensive
                            note of the spiral structure. To observe the spiral structure in modern instruments requires
                            a fairly large instrument, very dark skies, and a low-power eyepiece.

                            around a trillion stars. It has a high population of H II regions, many of which are very
                            large and bright. It is asymmetrical due to the tidal forces from interactions with its
                            companion galaxies, which compress interstellar hydrogen gas and trigger strong star
                            formation activity in its spiral arms.

                            an ultra-luminous X-ray source, receiving the designation M101 ULX-1. Further observations
                            showed that the system deviated from expected models, with the black hole being just 20 to
                            30 solar masses and consuming material at a higher rate than theory suggests. It is
                            estimated that M101 has about 150 globular clusters, the same as the number of the Milky
                            Way's globular clusters.</span></font>
