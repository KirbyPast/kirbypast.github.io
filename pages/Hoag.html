                            Serpens Caput.It is named after Arthur Hoag, who discovered it in 1950 and identified it
                            as either a planetary nebula or a peculiar galaxy. The galaxy has approximately eight
                            billion stars, and is roughly 120,000 light years across.

                            star clusters that are almost too faint to see. Another more distant ring galaxy can be seen
                            through Hoag's Object, between the nucleus and the outer ring of the galaxy, at roughly the
                            one o'clock position in the image shown here. Noah Brosch and colleagues showed that the
                            luminous ring lies at the inner edge of a much larger neutral hydrogen ring.

                            Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies, the Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies, or
                            the catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae. It was initially proposed that the visible ring
                            was a product of gravitational lensing, but this idea was later discarded due to the nucleus
                            and the ring having the same redshift, and more advanced telescopes revealing the ring's
                            knotty structure, which would not be visible if the galaxy were a product of gravitational
                            lensing.

                            is how it formed. So-called "classic" ring galaxies are generally formed by the collision of
                            a small galaxy with a larger disk-shaped galaxy, producing a density wave in the disk that
                            leads to a characteristic ring-like appearance. However, there is no sign of any second
                            galaxy that would have acted as the "bullet", and the likely older core of Hoag's Object has
                            a very low velocity relative to the ring, making the typical formation hypothesis quite
                            unlikely.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Noah Brosch suggested that Hoag's Object might be a product of an
                            extreme "bar instability" that occurred a few billion years ago in a barred spiral galaxy,
                            but Swiss et al claim this is an unlikely hypothesis. A few other galaxies share the primary
                            characteristics of Hoag's Object, including a bright detached ring of stars, but their
                            centers are elongated or barred, and they may exhibit some spiral structure.</font>
