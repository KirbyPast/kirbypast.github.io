                            46.56 kiloparsecs (152,000 light-years approximately 765 kpc (2.5 million light-years) from
                            Earth and the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way. The galaxy's name stems from the area
                            of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named
                            after the princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.

                            the collision and subsequent merger of smaller protogalaxies. This violent collision formed
                            most of the galaxy's galactic halo and extended disk. Over the past 2 billion years, star
                            formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of
                            near-inactivity. </span></font>

                            M110, or others that have already been absorbed by the Andromeda Galaxy, which have formed
                            structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million
                            years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the
                            center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young stellar population.

                            data from the 2MASS survey and the Spitzer Space Telescope showed that it is actually a
                            barred spiral galaxy. There are various methods used in astronomy in defining the size of a
                            galaxy, with the most commonly employed being the D25 standard. In 2005, the Keck telescopes
                            showed the existence of a tenuous sprinkle of stars, or galactic halo, extending outward
                            from the galaxy. This diffuse halo extends outwards away from Andromeda's main disc with the
                            diameter of 67.45 kiloparsecs (220,000 light-years).

                            are separated by 1.5 pc (4.9 ly). P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric
                            orbit around the central black hole, while P2 contains a compact disk of hot, spectral-class
