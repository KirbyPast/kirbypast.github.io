                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies
                            beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to
                            directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small
                            margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is
                            made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has only
                            one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one third its volume.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from
                            30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometers)from the Sun. Light from the Sun
                            takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km). Pluto's
                            eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital
                            resonance prevents them from colliding.

                            It was immediately hailed as the ninth planet, but it was always the odd object out, and its
                            planetary status was questioned when it was found to be much smaller than expected.

                            Greek epithet for Hades.Upon the announcement of the discovery, Lowell Observatory received
                            over a thousand suggestions for names.Three names topped the list: Minerva, Pluto and
                            Cronus. 'Minerva' was the Lowell staff's first choice but was rejected because it had
                            already been used for an asteroid.

                            Disney was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for Mickey Mouse a canine companion
                            named Pluto, although Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen could not confirm why the name was
                            given.

                            cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised
                            downward throughout the 20th century.In 1978, the discovery of Pluto's moon Charon allowed
                            the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth,in 1992,
                            Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the
                            estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to
                            recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus.</font>

                            nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are
                            most abundant on the anti-Charon face of Pluto (around 180° longitude, where Tombaugh
                            Regio's western lobe, Sputnik Planitia, is located), whereas methane is most abundant near
                            300° east. The mountains are made of water ice.

                            brightness and color. Pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the Solar System, with
                            as much contrast as Saturn's moon Iapetus. The color varies from charcoal black, to dark
                            orange and white.Pluto's color is more similar to that of Io with slightly more orange and
                            significantly less red than Mars.

                        <font style="font-size: 13pt">Pluto has a tenuous atmosphere consisting of nitrogen (N2),
                            methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO), which are in equilibrium with their ices on Pluto's
                            surface.According to the measurements by New Horizons, the surface pressure is about 1 Pa
                            (10 μbar), roughly one million to 100,000 times less than Earth's atmospheric pressure. It
                            was initially thought that, as Pluto moves away from the Sun, its atmosphere should
                            gradually freeze onto the surface; studies of New Horizons data and ground-based
                            occultations show that Pluto's atmospheric density increases, and that it likely remains
                            gaseous throughout Pluto's orbit.

                            nitrogen to be 10,000 times less than expected. Alan Stern has contended that even a small
                            increase in Pluto's surface temperature can lead to exponential increases in Pluto's
                            atmospheric density; from 18 hPa to as much as 280 hPa (three times that of Mars to a
                            quarter that of the Earth). At such densities, nitrogen could flow across the surface as
                            liquid.Just like sweat cools the body as it evaporates from the skin, the sublimation of
                            Pluto's atmosphere cools its surface.
