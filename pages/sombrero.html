                            4594) is a peculiar galaxy of unclear classification 1 in the constellation borders of Virgo
                            and Corvus, being about 9.55 megaparsecs (31.1 million light-years) 1 from the Milky Way
                            galaxy. It is a member of the Virgo II Groups, a series of galaxies and galaxy clusters 1.
                            The galaxy can be seen across the spectrum and is host to a central supermassive black hole
                            2.

                            prominent dust lane in its outer disk, which is viewed almost edge-on. The dark dust lane
                            and the bulge give it the appearance of a sombrero hat (thus the name).

                            visible with amateur telescopes, and is considered by some authors to be the galaxy with the
                            highest absolute magnitude within a radius of 10 megaparsecs of the Milky Way. Its large
                            bulge, central supermassive black hole, and dust lane all attract the attention of
                            professional astronomers.

                            lane that crosses in front of the bulge of the galaxy. This dust lane is actually a
                            symmetrical ring that encloses the bulge of the galaxy. Most of the cold atomic hydrogen gas
                            and the dust lie within this ring.

                            molecular gas, although this is an inference based on observations with low resolution and
                            weak detections. Additional observations are needed to confirm that the Sombrero galaxy's
                            molecular gas is constrained to the ring. Based on infrared spectroscopy, the dust ring is
                            the primary site of star formation within this galaxy.

                            region (LINER) where ionized gas is present, but the ions are only weakly ionized. Infrared
                            spectroscopy observations have demonstrated that the nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy is
                            probably devoid of any significant star formation activity, but a supermassive black hole
                            has been identified in the nucleus.

                            revolution of the stars within the center of the galaxy could not be maintained unless a

                            1781. Charles Messier made a hand-written note about it and five other objects to his
                            personal list of objects, but it was not "officially" included until 1921.

                            found Messier's personal list of the Messier objects, including the hand-written notes about
                            the Sombrero Galaxy, and declared that it should be included in the Messier Catalogue. Since
                            then, the Sombrero Galaxy has been known as M104.</span></font>
